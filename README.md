# E-Book Automation Research Project
## By Matt Favela B.S. Data Science, Chapman University

## Project Scope
### Project Vision
* The vision for this project is to ultimately be a template for others to use to write e-books automatically
* There is a small boom in the e-book automation industry so I would like to do some innovating to help anyone get involved
* I hope to also learn more about automation with python and formatting something this big
## Project Description
### Problem
* There is no standard format or guide to follow when trying to use the capabilities of GPT-3 to write e-books
### Target Audience
* Writers looking for inspiration
* Entrepreneurs that want to write e-books at a rapid pace
* Hobbyists who want to play around with AI and make something cool
### Needs
* The online community needs a push in the right direction in this new business
* We need a very structured outline of creating e-books with GPT-3
* We need more open sourced projects in this area of research (ai)
## Goals and My Approach
### Goals
* Goal 1: Generate the first three chapters of an e-book
* Goal 2: Automate some of the processes
* Goal 3: Create a formatted template for others to use
### My Approach
* I will be using GPT-3 to generate the content and ideas
* I will be sticking to the following niches: fitness, e-commerce, relationships
* I will add useful comments along the way and easily readable naming conventions
## Project Acceptance Criteria
* Acceptance Criteria 1: Write the first three chapters of an e-book and export to document
* Acceptance Criteria 2: There must be a guide to go alone with the steps
* Acceptance Criteria 3: There must be some kind of automation built in
## Project Deliverables
* Jupyter notebook example of an e-book automation
* Jupyter notebook template OR TEMPLATE.md template
* E-Book generator simplified
## Project Exclusions
* I am not creating the generative predictive transformer model by scratch, instead I will use the OPEN AI api make calls to davinci003 
## Project Assumptions
* I am assuming that I will not need to invest more than $10 of my own money into making this
* I am assuming that I can split up the task by sections of chapters
# Budget
* Max $10 of my money on gpt-responses (375,000 token limit) and (675,000 tokens) $18 in spending credit I recieved from them for free
* I am allowing up to $15 to be spent on a celebration meal for completing the project
